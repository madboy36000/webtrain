# Limi Lighting EPDP/EPDVP Webapp

This repository contains a fully static, bilingual (English/Chinese) web application for training on Limi Lighting's Engineering & Product Development procedures.

Open `index.html` in a modern browser to use the app. All logic is in `app.js` and phase content in `data.js` so updates are easy without modifying the markup.

Use `node --check` on the JS files if you need to verify syntax.
