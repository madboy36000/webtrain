Limi Lighting: Engineering Prototyping & Design Validation Procedure (EPDVP) - V1.0


Document Purpose:
This document outlines the standard procedure for the Limi Lighting Engineering Department to rapidly develop, prototype, validate, and finalize product designs. The primary goals are to:
* Accelerate the early-stage development cycle.
* Ensure a high degree of confidence in design viability, manufacturability, and alignment with product vision before full-scale supplier engagement for mass production parts.
* Minimize costly errors, reduce wasted sampling, and shorten lead times.
* Foster innovation and robust design through iterative internal validation.
* Create comprehensive "Pre-Production Design Packages" for seamless handoff to Purchasing and Production.
Scope:
This procedure applies to all new product development and significant updates to existing products undertaken by the Limi Lighting Engineering Department.
Guiding Principles:
* Internal First: Maximize the use of in-house resources (3D printers, CNC machines, laser cutters, workshop tools) for initial prototyping and validation.
* Iterate Rapidly: Embrace quick, low-cost internal iterations to refine designs.
* Validate Early, Validate Often: Continuously check form, fit, function, and manufacturability.
* Clear Handoffs: Ensure complete and unambiguous information is passed to other departments.
* Documentation is Key: Maintain clear, version-controlled records of designs, prototypes, tests, and decisions.
* Collaboration: Work closely with the Product Manager (Umer) at key decision points.

* [ ] Lead Engineer (Mark) and QC Lead formally sign off on the samples that meet all specifications.
* [ ] These approved samples become the "Golden Samples" / "Master Samples".
* [ ] Documentation of Golden Samples (CRITICAL):
* [ ] Take high-quality, well-lit photographs from multiple angles of each individual Golden Sample part and the fully assembled Golden Sample unit.
* [ ] Clearly label each Golden Sample part: [Project Name]_[Part Name/Number]_GOLDEN_V1.0_[Date]_[Signatures].
* [ ] Store one complete set of Golden Samples securely (e.g., locked cabinet, QC lab) – this set is for reference ONLY and not to be disassembled or used for further testing unless absolutely necessary for dispute resolution.
* [ ] A second "Working Golden Sample" set can be kept by Engineering/Production for ongoing reference during trial production and initial mass production runs.
* [ ] All photos and sign-off documentation are stored in NAS: [Project Name]/Phase 5 - Sample Evaluation/03_Golden_Samples_Documentation/. Update Trello status to "Golden Samples Approved."
* Output: Approved and documented Golden Samples, ready to be used as the standard for mass production.

   * [ ] REJECTED (Return to Trial Production or Earlier Phase): Significant issues remain with the product, process, or documentation that prevent confident mass production.
      * Action: Document reasons, create an action plan, and re-loop to the appropriate phase. This is a serious escalation.
Checklist for Decision Gate 3 (to be completed by Production Lead before review):
* Trial production run completed successfully? (Y/N)
* Trial production units meet quality standards against Golden Samples? (Y/N)
* Assembly times and defect rates within acceptable limits? (Y/N - specify limits)

SECTION 7: MASS PRODUCTION LAUNCH & ONGOING MONITORING
Objective: To successfully launch mass production, ensuring consistent quality and efficiency, and to establish mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and continuous improvement.
Prerequisites:
* Successful completion of DECISION GATE 3: Readiness for Mass Production.
* All final documentation (Assembly SOPs, QC Checklists, Packaging Instructions, Final PPDP) is approved, version controlled, and accessible to relevant teams.
* Purchasing has secured components for the initial mass production runs.
* Production has scheduled the first mass production runs.
Participants:
* Lead: Production Lead/Manager.
* Key Involvement: QC Team, Assembly Team, Engineering (for initial support & troubleshooting), Purchasing (for component supply).
* Oversight: Product Manager (Umer Asif).
7.1. First Mass Production Run (FMPR) Preparation:
* Action (Production Lead):
* [ ] Conduct a final pre-production meeting with Production Supervisors, QC, and key assembly staff.
* [ ] Re-confirm understanding of all SOPs, QC checkpoints, and quality standards using the Golden Samples and Final Production Package.
* [ ] Ensure all workstations are set up correctly with calibrated tools, approved jigs/fixtures, and readily available components.
* [ ] Verify that incoming components for the FMPR have passed incoming QC checks as per established procedures.
* [ ] Output: Production line ready for FMPR.
7.2. First Mass Production Run Execution & Heightened Monitoring:
* Action (Production Team, with close supervision by Production Lead, QC, and Engineering):
* [ ] Initiate the First Mass Production Run.
* [ ] Intensive QC Monitoring: QC performs checks at a higher frequency during the FMPR (e.g., every Nth unit off the line, random spot checks at each station) to quickly identify any deviations from the Golden Sample or SOPs.
* [ ] Engineering Support: Lead Engineer (Mark) or a designated engineer should be available (ideally on-site for the very first run) to rapidly troubleshoot any unexpected technical or assembly issues that arise and were not caught in trial production.
* [ ] Production Lead Oversight: Continuously monitor workflow, assembly times, and initial defect rates.
* [ ] Any issues encountered are immediately documented, and if critical, production may be paused to rectify before producing more defects.
* Output: Units from FMPR. Detailed FMPR Report including yield rates, defect analysis, issues encountered, and any immediate corrective actions taken. Store in NAS: [Project Name]/Phase 7 - Mass Production/01_FMPR_Report.docx. Trello updated.
7.3. Post-FMPR Review & Process Stabilization:
* Participants: Production Lead, QC Lead, Lead Engineer, Product Manager.
* Action:
* [ ] Review the FMPR Report.
* [ ] Analyze any issues or deviations.
* [ ] If necessary, make minor adjustments to SOPs, QC Checklists, or workstation setups to stabilize the process. (Significant changes require re-validation, potentially a mini-trial).
* [ ] Confirm that the production process is stable and capable of consistently meeting quality standards at the required throughput.
* Decision (Product Manager & Production Lead):
* [ ] Approve continuation of mass production.
* [ ] Or, if significant issues persist, schedule further troubleshooting and potentially another controlled production run before full ramp-up.
* Output: FMPR Review Minutes & Action Plan (if any). Decision to proceed with ongoing mass production. Store in NAS.
7.4. Ongoing Mass Production & Routine Monitoring:
* Action (Production Lead & QC Lead):
* [ ] Production continues according to the finalized SOPs and production schedule.
* [ ] QC performs routine in-process quality checks (IPQC) and final product quality assurance (FQA) as per the established QC Plan.
* [ ] Production data (yields, defect rates, downtime) is collected and monitored regularly (e.g., daily/weekly).
* [ ] Regular (e.g., weekly) production meetings are held to review performance, discuss any emerging issues, and plan for upcoming runs.
* Output: Ongoing production. Regular Production & QC Reports. Store in NAS: [Project Name]/Phase 7 - Mass Production/02_Ongoing_Production_Reports/ and .../03_Ongoing_QC_Reports/. Trello boards for orders reflect actual production status.

SECTION 8: CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT & POST-LAUNCH REVIEW
Objective: To establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement of the product and production processes based on mass production data, market feedback, and new technological opportunities.
Participants: Product Manager (Umer Asif), Lead Engineer (Mark), Production Lead, QC Lead, Purchasing Lead, (Sales/Marketing representatives when market feedback is reviewed).
8.1. Data Collection & Analysis:
* Action (All Department Leads):
* [ ] Continuously collect data related to:
* Production yields, defect rates, rework rates.
* Assembly times, line balancing efficiency.
* Supplier component quality and delivery performance.
* Customer feedback, returns, warranty claims (once product is in market).
* QC inspection results.
* [ ] Output: Regular performance dashboards/reports.
8.2. Periodic Post-Launch Review Meetings:
* Action (Product Manager to schedule, e.g., quarterly or after first X,000 units shipped):
* [ ] Conduct formal Post-Launch Review meetings.
* [ ] Review all collected performance data.
* [ ] Identify trends, areas for improvement in the product design (for future revisions), production processes, QC methods, or supplier performance.
* [ ] Discuss any significant customer feedback or field issues.
* [ ] Brainstorm opportunities for cost reduction, quality enhancement, or efficiency gains.
* Output: Post-Launch Review Meeting Minutes with identified improvement opportunities and assigned action items. Store in NAS: [Project Name]/Phase 8 - Continuous Improvement/01_Post_Launch_Reviews/.
8.3. Implementing Improvements:
* Action (Assigned Leads):
* [ ] For identified improvement opportunities:
* If it involves a design change, a new Engineering Change Request (ECR) is initiated, potentially re-triggering relevant parts of this EPDVP for that specific change.
* If it involves a process change, update relevant SOPs, train staff, and monitor impact.
* If it involves a supplier issue, Purchasing addresses it with the supplier.
* [ ] Track the implementation and effectiveness of improvements.
* Output: Documented changes, updated SOPs, ECRs.
8.4. Lessons Learned & Knowledge Base Update:
* Action (Lead Engineer & Product Manager):
* [ ] Periodically (e.g., annually or per major project completion) consolidate key lessons learned from the EPDVP execution.
* [ ] Update any general best practice guides, checklists, or training materials for the Engineering department based on these learnings.
* [ ] Share relevant insights with other teams.
* Output: Updated knowledge base, lessons learned repository. Store in a central Engineering NAS folder.

This completes the full Engineering Prototyping & Design Validation Procedure, from initiation to continuous improvement.
Key considerations based on your previous inputs that have been woven in:
* Emphasis on Internal Capabilities: The plan strongly leverages your upcoming in-house CNC, laser cutters, etc., for rapid internal prototyping (Sections 2 & 3).
* Clear Handoffs & Decision Gates: Structured to ensure one phase is properly completed before moving to the next, which should help keep things moving fast in the right direction.
* Role of Engineering (Mark): Clearly positioned as the lead for design, internal prototyping, and technical validation up to the point of external sampling.
* Best Practices: Follows a stage-gate like process, common in robust product development, with iterative loops within early phases. Emphasizes DFM/DFA early on.
* Documentation: Stresses clear, version-controlled documentation stored centrally (NAS) and status tracking (Trello).
* Avoiding Confusion: By defining clear outputs for each step and distinct phases, it aims to reduce the ambiguity you've experienced.
* "Fast" Prototyping: Achieved by empowering engineering with tools and a process to iterate internally before the slower, more expensive external sampling.
* Learning & Improvement: The final section ensures that the process itself is subject to review and improvement.
